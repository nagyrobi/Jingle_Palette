<p>Each button can have its own jingle but Jingle Palette does not limit to 
that. You can save the jingles from the 30 buttons in palettes that you can load 
very easily.</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Assign"></a>Assigning Jingles to buttons</font></b></p>

<p>If you want to have a jingle on a button here's what you have to do: On the
<i>Palettes</i> tab, Click <i>
Assign Jingle to Button</i>. All the buttons will turn pink, that will allow you 
to pick a button where you want to put a new jingle: </p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/AssignMode.png" width="600" height="426"></p>

<p>So click the desired button, regardless if it's empty or has already a 
jingle. A file requester appears that allows you to select a jingle from your 
computer. It can be any MP3, MP2, MP1, OGG or WAV audio file. Right-clicking on 
a jingle button and selecting <i>Assign Jingle</i> will bring you up the same 
file requester:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/AssSelJing.png" width="563" height="419"></p>

<p>Pressing Open will simply put it on the button, and you're ready to play. </p>

<p>This way you can fill all the buttons with jingles and create a palette of 
jingles.</p>

<p><b><u>Note:</u></b> If you don't pick a pink button in 10 seconds after 
pressing <i>Assign Jingle to Button,</i> it will turn back to normal mode. You 
can click <i>Assign Jingle to Button</i> again. Pressing the &quot;A&quot; key will do the 
same as clicking <i>Assign Jingle to Button</i>. </p>

<p>Please use jingles from safe places only, like local hard drives or servers 
through high-speed networks. Do not assign jingles from CD-ROMs, or unsafe network 
locations.</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Clear"></a>Clearing Buttons</font></b></p>

<p>If you want to clear a button that has a jingle on it, go with the arrow keys 
and select it, and press the &quot;Delete&quot; key on your keyboard. You will be asked to 
confirm your choice. Right-clicking on a jingle button and selecting <i>Clear 
Button</i>, will do the same. </p>

<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> Pressing STOP ALL will reload the palette and thus will 
cancel the clearings. If you want to clear buttons permanently, you must save 
the palette after you cleared them. Watch out, after this step the only way to 
recover is to re-assign the jingles to the buttons. You can't clear buttons 
while they're playing. </p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Save"></a>Saving palettes</font></b></p>
<p>If you assigned jingles to buttons, you can save these assignments in 
palettes that you can reload easily with a single click.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/TabPalSave.png" width="362" height="170"></p>
<p>Click <i>Save Current Palette</i>. A textbox will appear on it that will 
allow you to type in a name for your palette. Press ENTER to save it. Your 
palette will appear on the right, in the listbox, and will load the jingles when 
you select a palette.</p>
<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> If you don't type anything in the textbox, it will 
disappear in 5 seconds. Also, if you click somewhere else before pressing ENTER, 
it will disappear. If you don't press enter within 60 seconds it will also 
disappear. You can always bring it back by clicking Assign<i> Jingle to Button</i> 
again. Pressing the &quot;S&quot; key will do the same as clicking <i>Save Current Palette</i>.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Blank"></a>Blank palettes</font></b></p>
<p>If you want to start from scratch, with all buttons empty, click <i>Stop and 
Empty Palette</i>. Current playback will stop and all the buttons will be cleared. 
You can now assign jingles to the empty buttons with the steps described above.</p>
<p>Your saved palettes will not disappear, you can reload them anytime. Use this 
when creating new palettes.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Change"></a>Changing palettes</font></b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Img/PalNav.png" align="left" width="86" height="167">You 
can save as many palettes as you wish, for example you can save one for each 
show you have and give the title of the show to the palette. Or every DJ can 
create a personalized palette for him/herself. </p>
<p>Changing palettes can be done by directly clicking on them in the listbox, or 
by clicking <i>Previous Palette </i>or<i> Next Palette.</i> The highlight in the 
listbox will move up or down accordingly and load the highlighted palette. </p>
<p>The currently selected palette, the previous and next ones are shown on the
<a href="display.htm">display</a>.</p>
<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> You can click <i>Previous Palette </i>or<i> Next Palette </i>
even if the <i>Palettes</i> tab is not visible.<i> </i>Pressing PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN on your keyboard will give the same results.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Delete"></a>Deleting palettes</font></b></p>
<p>If there is a palette you wish to delete, select by clicking on it it and 
press DELETE on your keyboard. A dialog box will appear, asking you to confirm 
your action:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/DeleteConfirm.png" width="326" height="126"></p>
<p>If you answer Yes, the selected palette will be permanently deleted. If you 
answer No, nothing will happen.</p>
<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> Deletion of palettes is permanent. Once deleted, they cannot be brought 
back. They are saved in the <i>palettes.ini</i> file, in the program folder 
where <b>Jingle Palette</b> is installed (usually <i>C:\Program Files\Jingle 
Palette</i>). If you want, you can make a backup of this file before you start 
deleting any palettes, just to avoid mistakes.</p>
