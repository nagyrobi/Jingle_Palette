<p>Settings allow you to customize Jingle Palette the way you like.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Img/TabSet.png" width="361" height="169"></p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Vol"></a>Setting the Volume</font></b></p>

<p>You can set the volume level globally, for the general output of <b>Jingle 
Palette</b>, and individually, for each jingle. This individual setting is saved 
in the palette.</p>

<p><b>To set the individual</b> volume for each jingle, click <i>Assign new 
Volume level to Jingle</i> button. All the buttons on the palette will turn 
blue, so you can choose a jingle to set its volume.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Img/SetVol.png" width="600" height="426"></p>

<p>After clicking the desired jingle button, on the settings panel the blue 
volume fader will appear, allowing you to precisely set the volume by dragging 
it. Right-clicking on a jingle button and selecting <i>Assign Volume Level</i> 
will bring up the same thing:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/TabSetVol.png" width="362" height="169"></p>

<p>After setting the desired volume, click on <i>Save Volume</i> to save it in 
the palette and return to the initial state.</p>

<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> You can start playing the jingle and after that press the<i> 
Assign new Volume level to Jingle</i> button to set the volume while listening.</p>

<p><b>To set the main output volume</b> level from <b>Jingle Palette</b>, click
<i>Settings...</i> and in the configuration window, on the Audio tab, drag the 
red fader to select the desired volume. </p>

<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> You can start playing a jingle and after that go to 
Settings to set the main output volume while listening. To reset to 0 dB, you 
can click the number above the fader.</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Loop"></a>Setting Loop mode individually</font></b></p>

<p>Each jingle can be played in Loop mode, and this preference is also saved in 
the palette. To do that, click the <i>Assign/Clear Loop Mode</i> button. All the 
palette will turn orange, allowing you to select a jingle to be played in Loop 
mode:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/SetLoop.png" width="600" height="426"></p>

<p>Clicking a jingle will enable its Loop playback mode. To remind you about 
this state, an orange LED is lit up on the button. If you play a jingle while 
this is on, that jingle will be looped (e.g. repeated) until you stop it in some 
way, either with STOP ALL, or by clicking it again without the Autorepeat mode 
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><u><b>Note:</b></u> For best results, it is recommended to store jingles that 
you wish to loop in PCM WAV, Mp1 or Mp2 format only. We do not recommend Mp3 for 
looping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Right-clicking on a jingle button and 
selecting <i>Set(Clear) Loop Mode</i> will to the same.</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Adv"></a>Advanced Settings</font></b></p>

<p>Clicking the<i> Settings...</i> button will bring you up the 
Configuration Settings window, which will allow you to choose different options 
for <b>Jingle Palette</b>:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/SettingsDisplay.png" width="414" height="265"></p>
<p>Here you can choose the Time and Date display format, the number of seconds 
after which the warning rectangle will appear on the
<a href="display.htm">display</a>, the color of it.</p>
<p>The Auto Mix time can be set in milliseconds. The default is 1500 (1.5 
seconds) but you can specify any value between 100 and 3000.</p>
<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> The values of the Remaining warning time, Auto Mix time, 
etc. can be changed by clicking the little Up/Down arrows, or from keyboard by 
pressing UP, DOWN keys in the corresponding number box. Pressing LEFT or RIGHT 
will change the values more rapidly.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/SettingsAudio.png" width="414" height="265"></p>
<p>The <a href="timeann.htm">Time Announce</a> signal can be 
chosen here in a similar way that jingle assignment is done.</p>
<p>The output device can also be chosen from the settings window. If you change 
the output device, all output will stop, the audio module will reset and reload 
the palette on the new device, as the message box will warn you. So if you have 
a jingle on air, you can wait until it finishes if you want and then press OK:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/NewDevice.png" width="375" height="126"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">If you select an unsupported device, you will be warned accordingly.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">To set the main output volume from 
this window, see above.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/SettingsOthers.png" width="414" height="265"></p>

<p>The Process Priority Thread can be chosen here from <i>Idle</i> to <i>Time 
Critical</i>. This is useful in case you want to fine tune the software 
compatibility between programs running together on the same computer system. 
Multitasking environments differ from one operating system to another. In any 
case, the <i>Time Critical</i> priority is not recommended, it can cause system 
lockup and instability. A message will warn you in this case to be cautious. <i>
Save all errors to &quot;Error.log&quot; file </i>checked saves not only the program 
errors, but also the missing jingles, and other user-generated errors to a 
logfile to check later. <i>Always On Top of all the other windows </i>checked 
makes Jingle Palette to be the topmost window on your desktop. That's helpful 
when using with other broadcasting tools.</p>

<p>Changing the language of the interface can be done easily, by selecting the 
desired language from the dropdown box. To have <b>Jingle Palette</b> translated 
in your language, see <i><a href="translate.htm">Translating Jingle Palette in 
other languages</a></i> section. It's easy and anyone can do it.</p>
<p>You can choose to save the program errors to a log file. This is useful if a 
certain error occurs repeatedly, because you can send it to the author for 
debugging and problem fixing.</p>
