<p><b>Jingle Palette</b> can work very well along other audio players, including Winamp 
or other professional broadcasting automation tools. It totally depends on the other 
programs if they can tolerate or not external players in the same time they play.</p>

<p>Note that many software manufacturers state that using other players among&nbsp; 
their own may damage the job that they do. Sometimes it's true, but sometimes 
it's not. </p>

<p>If you have a system that has one or more soundcards, and DirectX is 
installed, it's 99% certain that you can use <b>Jingle Palette </b>along with your existing 
software. Especially if the other software is also working with DirectX, then 
it's 100% sure that they can work together without bothering each other, even on 
the same soundcard for broadcasting output.</p>

<p>Check the other software's documentation. If it states that &quot;DirectX is 
required&quot; or during its installation it warns you about that, or installs 
DirectX, etc, then its almost sure that it's using it. Then, there's no problem. 
(You can check the version of your installed DirectX by typing &quot;dxdiag&quot; in the 
Run box from the Start Menu)</p>

<p>There are lots of possible setups. You can use one single soundcard for the 
output in the main studio mixer, and use <b>Jingle Palette </b>along with some music 
player/broadcast manager. You can use two soundcards like some broadcast manager 
software require, the first one for the ON AIR output, and the second one for 
monitoring, in this case you must setup <b>Jingle Palette</b> to output on the first 
card (check <a href="settings.htm">Settings</a> section).</p>

<p>You can even throw in an extra soundcard if you want to, only for <b>Jingle 
Palette</b>, that you can also wire in the broadcast mixer on a separate channel. 
This in case of some player/broadcast manager that doesn't use DirectX or likes 
to lock the soundcards exclusively for itself; or if you want to be 1000% sure 
that they run&nbsp; independently.</p>

<p>Windows 2000 or Windows XP is HIGHLY recommended. They do multitasking way 
better and multiple applications run in parallel much better and more stable. 
This is not a warranty though that the two or more programs will run together 
smoothly. Memory, running services, networking, especially the quality of the 
hardware components, all affect PC performance. <b>Jingle Palette</b> offers you 
the possibility to choose the process thread priority if you need to fine tune 
compatibility between programs.</p>

<p>It's best to try yourself, but watch out, you're on your own responsibility. </p>

<p>The author of this document and of the program called Jingle Palette is not 
responsible for anything that may happen due to correct or incorrect procedures 
executed by users in certain environments. </p>

<p>Make sure you have backups of your broadcast and data before you start 
experimenting. Never make tries while you're ON AIR! It's best to try first on a 
separate computer, the production studio PC or the newsroom for example.</p>

<p><b>Jingle Palette</b> plays MP3, MP2, MP1, MPA, OGG and WAV audio files or 
streams. It also supports compressed WAV files with the condition that you have 
installed the appropriate codec on your system. </p>
