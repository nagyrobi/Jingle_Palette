<p>The display shows you information regarding the jingles, functionality and 
time.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/display.gif" width="388" height="214"> </p>

<p>The remaining time is displayed only for the last jingle played. It shows seconds and milliseconds 
in two digits each, and minutes in one digit. If the remaining time is below 1 
minute, the the minute digit displays &quot;-&quot; as a sign for remaining time. </p>

<p>The red frame around the remaining time appears to warn you when there are 
only 3 seconds left of the jingle. The time when it appears and its color can be 
customized from the <a href="settings.htm">settings</a> window.</p>

<p>The clock (<font size="4" face="Wingdings">&frac12;</font><font size="4"></font>) is 
displayed only when <a href="timeann.htm">Time Announce</a> 
function is turned on. It disappears automatically when announcing finishes.<img border="0" src="Img/VuMeter.png" align="right" width="50" height="353"></p>

<p>The red warning sign appears when <b>Jingle Palette</b> has a message for you, in the above 
example the framed &quot;x&quot; (<font face="Wingdings">x</font>) means that there is an 
error. The red hourglass (<font face="Wingdings">6</font>) means that you must 
wait for something to finish (for example palette loading) and the floppy disk (<font face="Wingdings">&lt;</font>) shows 
that save completed successfully. Moving the mouse above the sign will pop up a 
balloon with the description of the event. Clicking it will turn the warning 
off.</p>

<p>The name of the currently selected palette is shown in green, above is the 
previous palette, below is the next palette.</p>

<p>The clock displays the current time in 24 hour format, or 12 hour AM/PM format. 
This can be chosen in the <a href="settings.htm">Settings</a> window.</p>

<p>The week number is in the middle, it counts the weeks considering that 
the first day of the week is Monday.</p>

<p>The current date can also be displayed in several ways, see the
<a href="settings.htm">Settings</a> window for details.</p>

<p>The current day is at the right, right below the clock. Please note that the language of the date 
and day depends on the regional settings of your computer. Please set correctly 
the regional settings in Control Panel according to your location.</p>
