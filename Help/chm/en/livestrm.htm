<p>Remote streams can be played through internet or intranet with <b>Jingle 
Palette</b>. The supported formats for the streams are MP3, MP2, MP1, MPA, OGG or WAV 
audio, respectively live Shoutcast / Icecast streams. </p>

<p>On the <i>Play Stream</i> tab, you can type the URL of the remote file in the 
bar. Clicking the <i>Play Remote Location</i> button will start the connection 
with the server and play the file. In case of some error, the corresponding 
message will appear in the status box.</p>

<p><i>Auto Mix by Time Announce</i> function is useful if you want to stop the 
playback of the remote stream with the Time Announce. Simply set up
<a href="timeann.htm">Time Announce</a> at the desired moment and 
then click this button.</p>

<p>The address bar remembers all your URLs that you played in the history, so 
you can easily reuse them and don't have to type them in again.</p>

<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> If your internet/intranet connection is lost during 
playback, it will be stopped automatically after the remaining sound from the 
download memory buffer will empty.</p>

<p><u><b>Warning!</b></u> The remote location playback will be stopped when STOP 
ALL button is pressed.</p>
