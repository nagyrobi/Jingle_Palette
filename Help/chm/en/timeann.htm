<p>The Time Announce function is useful if you want to announce ON AIR with some 
signal the exact hour, or some special event. The included generic signal is 
used by default, but from <a href="settings.htm">Settings</a> you can choose a 
personalized one for your station.</p>

<p>On the Time Announce tab, first you have to select the minute and the second 
of the hour when you want the signal to start playing. Then press the Time 
Announce button, or press the &quot;N&quot; key on your keyboard:</p>

<p>Its name will change to a text suggesting when will the announcing take 
place. The display shows a clock sign, as a reminder that Time Announce is on.</p>

<p>Now that the time announce has been set, you can select a jingle that you 
wish to play right after the time announce signal. Choose a palette that 
contains the desired jingle and Press <i>Select jingle to be announced...,</i>
or press the &quot;C&quot; button on your keyboard.<i> </i>
All the buttons on the palette will be colored in blue, allowing you to designate a jingle. Pick one by 
clicking its button from the palette. Don't worry, it will not go on air, as 
long as you are blue, in the selection mode.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Img/TmaSel.png" width="600" height="426"></p>

<p>Right-clicking on a jingle button and selecting <i>Assign to Time Announce</i> 
will do the same thing. The <i>Select jingle to be announced... </i>button will stay pressed and 
blue, and its name will suggest that it will go ON AIR right by the end of 
the time announce signal.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/TabTmaJing.png" width="362" height="170"></p>

<p>You can modify the time it starts playing from the Jingle delay option, but 
it cannot be later than the length in seconds of the time announce signal 
itself.</p>

<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> The values of the Minute, Second, Jingle Delay can be 
changed by clicking the little Up/Down arrows, or from keyboard by pressing UP, 
DOWN keys in the corresponding number box. Pressing LEFT or RIGHT will change 
the values more rapidly. You can type in values. All these values can be changed even if the Time 
Announce buttons are pressed, but the Jingle Delay number box and the <i>Select 
jingle to be announced... </i>button will be enabled only if Time Announce is 
on.</p>

<p>If you don't pick a colored button in 10 seconds after 
pressing <i>Select 
jingle to be announced...,</i> it will turn back to normal mode. You can try 
again by clicking again, or right-clicking a jingle and selecting <i>Assign to 
Time Announce.</i></p>

<p><b><u>Warning!</u></b> Time Announce sounds will be stopped when STOP ALL 
button is pressed.</p>
