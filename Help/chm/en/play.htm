<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Play"></a>Simple Playback</font></b></p>

<p>To Play a jingle, simply click the button with its name:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/PlaySimp.png" width="154" height="61"></p>

<p>You can also start playback by pressing the SPACE bar on the selected jingle 
button, or right-clicking and selecting <i>Play</i>. A button is selected when a black rectangle is present on it (just like 
in the picture).</p>

<p>While playing, it will turn green and stay pressed so you know that it's ON AIR. The
<a href="display.htm">display</a> will show the remaining playback 
time of the jingle, and will warn you when it reaches its end. Also the VU meter 
will display the level of the sound.</p>

<p>The green button jumps back and gets back its original color when the jingle 
reaches to the end and stops.</p>

<p>You can stop the jingle in several ways. Clicking it, pressing SPACE bar on it again 
or right-clicking and selecting and selecting <i>Stop</i> while it's playing 
(green state) will stop the playback of the jingle. Pressing STOP ALL will do the 
same.</p>

<p>You can play several jingles at once. Just click on them in the order you 
wish, and they will start playing right away. There's no limit in how many 
jingles  play at once. You can even play jingles from different palettes in 
the same time.</p>

<p>You can stop them one by one by clicking them again while they are playing, 
or stop all at once by pressing STOP ALL. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Img/StopAll.png" width="80" height="80"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b><u>Note:</u> </b>This button stops all the audio output from Jingle 
Palette. This means that if you have <a href="timeann.htm">Time 
Announce</a> or a <a href="livestrm.htm">remote stream</a> playing, they will be stopped also. Pressing it also reloads the 
currently selected palette. Pressing ESCAPE button has the same effect as STOP 
ALL. You can move around with the selection of buttons (the black rectangle) by 
pressing TAB or the arrow keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">If you change the palette while 
jingles are playing, the state of the corresponding buttons will be raised even 
if you come back to the palette from which the jingle was launched from. The 
only way to stop the playing jingles in this case is pressing STOP ALL.</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Autorepeat"></a>Autorepeated Playback</font></b></p>

<p>Autorepeat mode can be turned on by clicking the Autorepeat button, just 
below the display:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="Img/ckAutoRep.png" width="82" height="84"></p>

<p>This mode differs from the simple mode in the way that when clicking again 
the playing jingle (while it's green), instead of stopping, it will play again 
from the beginning. This is useful for radio DJs when they wish to play ON AIR 
with some jingles on the beat of some song.</p>

<p>In this mode the only way to stop the jingle is pressing STOP ALL. If you 
right-click on a jingle while this is on, you will see the option to autorepreat 
it.</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Touch"></a>Touch Play</font></b></p>

<p>If this is pressed, the jingles will be play only while they are &quot;touched&quot; by 
mouse, screen or the SPACE key from keyboard.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Img/ckTouch.png" width="85" height="85"></p>

<p>Autorepeat and Touch Play cannot work together. They cancel each other.</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Mix"></a>Auto Mix function</font></b></p>

<p>This function is useful if you want to fade a playing jingle automatically 
while another one starts playing.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Img/ckMix.png" width="85" height="86"></p>

<p align="left">The mix time is set by default to 1.5 seconds, but this value 
can be changed in the <a href="settings.htm">settings</a> to any value.</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Pause"></a>Pausing playback of a jingle</font></b></p>
<p>Jingles can be paused individually by right-clicking on them while they are 
playing. Selecting <i>Pause</i> from the pop-up menu will pause playback and 
will flash the jingle's button. You can resume playback either by clicking the 
jingle normally again, or by right-clicking and selecting <i>Resume</i>. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Img/ppRes.png" width="164" height="83"></p>
<p align="left">You can also stop the paused jingle by right-clicking and 
selecting <i>Stop</i>.</p>
